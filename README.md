## Anomaly Detection Dashboard

##Project Overview
The Anomaly Detection Dashboard is an interactive web application built with Streamlit, enabling real-time detection and visualization of anomalies in time-series data.
It leverages Isolation Forest, PCA Reconstruction Error, and One-Class SVM to identify abnormal patterns efficiently and display results with dynamic visualizations.

## Features
Multi-Model Anomaly Detection: Combines Isolation Forest, PCA, and SVM
Real-Time Visualization with Plotly
Weighted Ensemble Scoring for better accuracy
Interactive Threshold Control for anomaly detection
Automated Output Generation with abnormality scores and top features
Dockerized Setup for seamless deployment
